How many primary shards should i create ?

- It depends on your data sets and feature.
- Max number of documents per shard is 2.1 billions.
- A shard can handle 25-50 GB efficiently.
- If u expecting high query or indexing rates, more primary shards can help distribute the load across the cluster.
    - Too many shards will affect the cluster management/operations | Also cost will increase.



2. How to change my primary shard count ?

- You can't do easily.
- If index is empty then delete and re-create.
- if not, we can't change, as it would affect the existing document indexed already.

- If needed badly then needs to create new index with needed shards then migrate old one.
