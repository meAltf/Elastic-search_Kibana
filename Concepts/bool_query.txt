# Leaf Vs Compound queries :

# strict:
- ids, term/terms, range, prefix,wildcard,regex
- These queries match documents exactly based on the specified values. 
- relevance score is 1 for all the records bcz as the result is binary(match or no match)


# flexible:
- match, multi match, match phrase
- These queries account for uncertainity, partial matches, misspellings etc.
- relevance score different.


# Leaf queries:
- ids, term/terms, range, prefix,wildcard,regex
- match, multi match, match phrase  

# compound queries:
