# Leaf Vs Compound queries :

# strict:
- ids, term/terms, range, prefix,wildcard,regex
- These queries match documents exactly based on the specified values. 
- relevance score is 1 for all the records bcz as the result is binary(match or no match)


# flexible:
- match, multi match, match phrase
- These queries account for uncertainity, partial matches, misspellings etc.
- relevance score different.


# Leaf queries:
- ids, term/terms, range, prefix,wildcard,regex
- match, multi match, match phrase  

# compound queries:
- Combining multiple leafe queries to make a complex query.


# Bool query:
- It combines multiple queries in a flexible way.
- It has 4 clauses:
    - filter(AND)
    - must(AND)
    - must_not(NOT)
    - should(OR)+score | Filter documents-> It depends



# Bool query | filter
- Used to filter documents matching specific conditions.
- It is idea for stric queries like ids, term, range etc.


# must_not
- NOT (filter) | logical NOT

# must
- filter + score

# should
- Yes -> If no "must" or "filter" clauses are defined, the "should" clause filter documents(acts as a OR filters)
- No, -> if "must" or "filter" clauses exists, the "should" doesn't filter documents , it's only add the score for relevance search
