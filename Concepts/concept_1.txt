## cluster

- A set of nodes of indices.
- Horizontal scalling
- Taking example of 4 primary shards(having data), but in a cluster we're having more than 10 shards with empty docuemts

## sharding :

- Process of splitting an index into smaller, more manageable units for scalling purpose. | Horizontal scalling
- Each unit is referred as a "primary shard".
- No, it's not same as segment.
- Each shard is 1 lucene index.


## segment :

- It's like a bunch of documents not same as shards.
- Each shard is 1 lucene index.
- shard to segments done by lucene(apache lucene) for fast search/read & write.


## Routing :

- In which shard, should i store my documents? How do i know that ?
- find the hashcode for routing key:
- shard = hash(routing_key) % number_of_primary_shards | ( routing_key is _id )


## scatter gather pattern

- when you search a "keyword" that does not present in index document so that time it will follow scatter-gather pattern.
- means that time request send to all shards, may be any docuemts contains related to that "keyword".
- and then response will be aggregated and send to columns.


## Replication

- Replica shard for high availibility.
- Each primary shard having their own replica shard in another node for backup data for high availibility.
- if one of the primary shard got down then their own replica shard takes over as a primary shard.
