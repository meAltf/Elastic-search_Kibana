# Analyzer
- A component used for text analysis during indexing and searching of text fields.
- It breaks down the text into tokens(terms) that can be searched frequently.

 -- Documents -> analyzer (character filter, tokenizer, token filters) -> disk
 -- text(search) -> analyzer -> disk


 - If there is no text fields, the concept of an analyzer is not required.


1. character filter :
- It works is- removing, replacing or normalizing text. | pre-processing
- ex: <b> Apple Iphone </b> -----> Apple Iphone

2. Tokenizer :
- After getting normalizing text , it will change text to terms
- ex: Apple Iphone -------> ["Apple", "Iphone"]

3. token filter :
- after getting token it will do some processing on each & every token it received.
- ex: ["Apple", "Iphone"]  --------> ["apple", "iphone"] 
- here it transform from uppercase to lowercase


NOTE: 
- Analyzer does not change/modify the _source doc. It scans/extracts token from the doc for search.
