Bool query guidelines:

step-1:
- First keep all the queries/conditions inside "filter"

step-2:
- Move any "NOT" conditions to "must_not"

step-3:
- Move any "OR" conditions / preferences conditions to "should" 
    - Either-or/good to have/optional

step-4:
- Move any text field queries to "must"(as we need score)
    - match/multi_match
