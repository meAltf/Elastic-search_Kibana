Data Mapping:
- It is a process of defining how a document, and the fields it contains, are stored and indexed.
- {name-> text, age->int, dob->date}


- Mapping types:
- Dynamic Mapping - Let elasticsearch figure it out
- Explicit Mapping - let me do it myself


- type : text:
- So analyzer will do text analysis.


- type : keyword:
- Store the value as it is in inverted index.
- Text analysis is skipped like dob, email, phoneNum these should be put inside keyword type.


- typr : numeric:
- Numeric fields are not analyzed.
- They are stored in BKD(block k dimensional) tree | used to efficiently build range queries
- for price, age, rating etc.
