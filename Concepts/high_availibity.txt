# To have a demo with high availibility, takes 3 node up and running. Do configuration in docker-compose.yml

- make one node down. [ docker compose stop "nodeName" ]
- Elastic automatically assign a new node for a node that gets down if available with a delay of 1 minutes (default)
- bcz it will re-try to connect with the same node before assigning to new one.
- may be due to network glictch or something it's failing so it will wait for a minute before assigning another node.

- But we can increase the delay time, by below property

PUT _all/_settings
{
  "settings": {
    "index.unassigned.node_left.delayed_timeout": "5m"
  }
}
