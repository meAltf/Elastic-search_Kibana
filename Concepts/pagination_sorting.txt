# Default responses are sorted by relevance score, means the response how relevant matched the search.

## Needs to do sorting based on our own requirements
- Prefer keyword/numeric/date fields for sorting
- text field can not be used for sorting as they are analyzed and tokenized.
    - If really required then use multi-field mapping
        - product_name : text
        - product_name.raw : keyword



## MODE ##
- Needs to use "mode", when you need to sort in a list of lists
# When you have multiple values, then pick:
- min
- max
- sum     ( for number types only)
- average ( for number types only)
- median  ( for number types only)
