## Node roles

- In a cluster -> many nodes -> many indices -> each node having one or more roles based on the configuration provided.


## master | treat as a winning MP in election

- Treat as a election, means after electing by multiple node there will a MASTER node.
- if somehow master node gets down, a new node will became master

- It manages the cluster state and coordinates cluster-wide-ranges
- Responsible for tasks like- creating/deleting indices, tracing node availibility, and managing shard allocation.


## voting only | treat as all MP in election

- Does not want to became master but can participate in election process
- Some node in cluster are configured in such a way that they can participate in electing process


## data

- Stores data and handles indexing and search operations for the shards it hosts
- That node needs Heavy on memory and disk usage
- Data node can be Hot, Ward, Cold it based on how frequently it accessed
- Hot means-> most recent & frequently accessed node and ward is less accessed and so on....


## coordinating node

- We will send the requests to these nodes. It route requests, distribute queries, and merge responses from shards.
- for above work we should not rely on master node, need to create a new coordinating node to take care of that.
- we can have a dedicated coordinating nodes in a large cluster.


## ingest node

- Process and tranfroms/improves data before indexing 
- using ingest pipelines
- Useful for data enrichments/improvement tasks-
    - add user location based on IP



NOTE:
- by default any node can perform any roles.
- to specify specifically role needs to use: node.rules: [....]
